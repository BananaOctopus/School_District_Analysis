# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
  We used multiple different data sets to analysis and hopefully better allocate funds to fifteen high schools based on their math and reading scores. Some data we looked at was their overall populations of students, the budget for each school and how much money was allocated per student. We farther analyized how many students passed their reading and/or math tests and how many of these students were in a large, medium or small school.
 
## Results
* How is the district summary affected?
* How is the school summary affected?
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    -Math and reading scores by grade
    -Scores by school spending
    -Scores by school size
    -Scores by school type

## Summary
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
